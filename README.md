# macDailyLockscreenQuotes
This is a small python program I made in combination with crontab and a quotes dataset which sets the Lock Screen message on macOS to a random quote from the database every day at 9:00am

To get it working on your machine if you'd like, replace the path strings in changeQuote.py, changeQuoteSetup.sh, and runChangeQuote.sh with your proper paths. After this, you can just run "changeQuoteSetup.sh" and everything should be working

If you need help getting it working, feel free to contact me!
