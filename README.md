# macDailyLockscreenQuotes
This is a small python program I made using a quotes dataset which sets the Lock Screen message on macOS to a random quote from the database every day at 9:00am.

To set up this script on your machine, run the following commands in the terminal while you are inside the lockscreenQuote folder:

```
chmod +x ./lockscreenQuoteSetup.sh
sudo ./lockscreenQuoteSetup.sh
```

To remove the script from your machine, run the following script:

```
sudo ./lockscreenDelete.sh
```

Thank you for downloading! If you encounter any errors with the program or are having issues with downloading, feel free to contact me at rowanrothe@icloud.com.
