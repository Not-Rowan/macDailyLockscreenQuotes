# macDailyLockscreenQuotes
This is a small python program I made in combination with crontab and a quotes dataset which sets the Lock Screen message on macOS to a random quote from the database every day at 9:00am.

To get it working on your machine, install the "quoteGenerator" folder and run the following commands inside the quoteGenerator folder from the terminal:
```
chmod +x ./changeQuoteSetup.sh
./changeQuoteSetup.sh
```

If you encounter any errors in the setup process, feel free to contact me!
